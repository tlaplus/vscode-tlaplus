## PlusCal

PlusCal (also written as +cal) is an imperative-style domain-specific language (DSL) built on top of TLA+. It provides a more familiar, algorithmic syntax while compiling down to TLA+ specifications.

While useful for expressing algorithms in a structured way, PlusCal is less expressive than TLA+ and can represent only a subset of what TLA+ can model.

⚠️ Note: Do not generate PlusCal code unless explicitly requested.
